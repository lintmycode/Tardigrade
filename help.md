# Intro
A simple stopwatch with task support.
Tasks group a series of laps and can be resumed when selected.

## Laps
Clicking on a lap opens lap time and lap actions.

## Tasks
Clicking on a task sets the task to active. Stopwatch will add a new lap to this task.

## Data persistency
The app uses the browser local storage only, therefore there's no data persistency across browsers or devices.

## Notes
- If the clock is running, task and lap operations are locked.
- There is no confirm dialog before a delete action, this is by design.

## Keyboard shortcuts
- [space bar] start/pause time
- [+] new task
- [t] edit task title
- [l] edit active lap title
